Hello World C-project
=====================

This is just a **"helloworld"** example project.

The only purpose of this project is to use as a scaffolding
C language project.

The project uses *CMakes* to build the executable, and *CHEAT* for
unit testing.


Build and execute
-----------------

1. From the source directory, generate the "Makefile":

       $ cmake .

2. *Make* the project and generate the executable "helloworld".

       $ make

3. Then execute with:

       $ out/helloworld

4. To install the executable `helloworld`
   into `/usr/local/bin`:

       $ sudo make install

   To install into another folder, execute the step 1
   overwriting the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable, eg.
   to install into `/usr/bin` folder:

       $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .
To clean the compiled binaries and compiled modules:
    $ make clean
To clean all compiled files and generated "Makefiles":
    $ make clean-all


Tests
-----

Tests are built with CHEAT <http://users.jyu.fi/~sapekiis/cheat/index.html>,
an unit testing framework for C/C++ programming language.

To run the tests, first build the project and then execute:

    $ out/test_say_hello
